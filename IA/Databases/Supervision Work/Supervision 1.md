> A relational implementation of an Entity-Relationship (ER) model typically attempts to avoid **redundancy**. But what does this mean exactly? Is **redundancy** the same thing as **duplication** of data values?

Data redundancy refers to when the same data is stored in multiple places in a database, specifically when it is unnecessary duplication of data. This can often happen when the same piece of data is used in multiple records, and can be avoided using entity-relationship models or other techniques to split data into multiple tables with links between them.
However, some data needs to be duplicated in a database, such as using foreign keys to connect records together across tables. Redundancy specifically refers to data that is stored multiple times unnecessarily.

a) 
A relation is a connection between two entities. In a relational schema it can be expressed as a line between entities, often with arrows to show if it is one-to-one, many-to-one, one-to-many or many-to-many. It can also have properties of its own.
