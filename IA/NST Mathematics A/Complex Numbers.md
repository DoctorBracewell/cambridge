**i** - The square root of `-1`
**Real Number** - One with no imaginary parts
**Imaginary Number** - A number containing `i`
**Complex Number** - A number with real and imaginary parts, often expressed as `z = x + iy`

Complex numbers can be added, multiplied (thanks to the identity `i*i = -1`), subtracted and divided.

Complex numbers inherit commutation and associativity from real numbers
