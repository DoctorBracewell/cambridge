**Definition 1** - An integer is said to be *odd* when it is of the form `2i + 1` for some necessarily unique integer `i`.

**Definition 2** - A number is *rational* if it is of the form `m/n` where `m` and `n` are integers.

**Definition 3** - Let `d` and `n` be integers. We say that `d` divides `n` and write `d|n` whenever there is an integer `k` such that `n = k * d`.

**Definition 4** - Fix a positive integer `m`. For integers `a` and `b`, we say that `a` is congruent to `b` modulo `m`, and write `a = b (mod m)` whenever `m | (a - b)` -> `(a - b) = k * m`
