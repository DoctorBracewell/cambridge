> The imperative program shown above is hardly cleaner or shorter than the functional example. Proving that it correctly implements Euclid's algorithm requires Floyd-Hoare proofs - a tedious enterprise. In contrast, the functional version obviously implements Euclid's algorithm.

> Beware of redeclaring a datatype. Each `datatype` declaration creates a new type distinct from all others. Suppose we have declared the type `degree` and the function `lady`. Now, repeat the declaration of `degree`. Asking for the type of `lady(Duke)` will elicit the type error: "expected type `degree`, found `degree`."
> Two different types are now called `degree`. This exasperating situation can happen while a program is being modified interactively. The surest remedy is to **terminate the ML session, start a new one, and load the program afresh**. (????????)
